    "- Look up the definition of permutations, and dropwhile from [itertools documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) in Python\n",
    "- Using permutations generate all possible three digit numbers that can be generated using 0, 1, and 2\n",
    "- Loop over this iterator and print them and also use `type` and `isinstance` to make sure that the return types are tuples\n",
    "- Use a single line code involving `dropwhile` and an lambda expression to convert all the tuples to lists while dropping any leading zeros (example - `(0, 1, 2)` becomes `[1, 2]`)\n",
    "- Write a function which takes a list like above and returns the actual number contained in it. Example - if you pass `[1, 2]` to the function it will return you `12`. Make sure it is indeed a number and not just a concatenated string. (Hint - You will need to treat the incoming list as a stack in the function to achieve this)"
