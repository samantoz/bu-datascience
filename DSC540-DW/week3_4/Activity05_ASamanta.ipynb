    "* **CRIM**: per capita crime rate by town\n",
    "* **ZN**: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n",
    "* **INDUS**: proportion of non-retail business acres per town\n",
    "* **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n",
    "* **NOX**: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n",
    "* **RM**: average number of rooms per dwelling\n",
    "* **AGE**: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n",
    "* **DIS**: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres\n",
    "* **RAD**: index of accessibility to radial highways\n",
    "* **TAX**: full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 dollars\n",
    "* **PTRATIO**: pupil-teacher ratio by town\n",
    "* **B**: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town\n",
    "* **LSTAT**: % of lower status of the population\n",
    "* **PRICE**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's"
